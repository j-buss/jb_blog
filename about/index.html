My name is Jeremy Buss. Throughout my life I have been inquisitive about the world.
This passion manifested early as a love of reading. Spending most evenings after school reading anything I could get my hands on.
I loved reading stories about people and how they grew up and made an impact.
It felt like I had a backstage pass to the lives of influential individuals.
As I progressed in high school and college this inquisitive nature led me to study physics and mathematics.
Later in high school and college this blossomed into the love of all things science and led to a degree in physics and astronomy research.
In the recent past my interests have been with data and cloud computing.
With the tools available in cloud anyone can build systems that were unimanigiable just a few years ago.
So most of my work will be concerned with leveraging cloud to enable data insights.</p>
<p>This site is a personal journey to hold me accountable to live my two guiding principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explore</li>
<li>Share</li>
</ol>
