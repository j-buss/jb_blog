My name is Jeremy Buss and throughout my life I have been inquisitive.
In elementary school this passion took the shape as a love of reading. I would spend most evenings after school reading anything I could get my hands on.
I especially loved reading stories about people and the impact they made. 
It felt like I had a backstage pass to the lives of influential individuals.

As I progressed through high school and into college this inquisitive nature led me to 
study physics and mathematics. Attending University Wisconsin Oshkosh gave me the opportunity to perform astrophysics research. 
 
Later in high school and college this blossomed into the love of all things science and led to a degree in physics and astronomy research.
In the recent past my interests have been with data and cloud computing. 
With the tools available in cloud anyone can build systems that were unimanigiable just a few years ago. 
So most of my work will be concerned with leveraging cloud to enable data insights.

This site is a personal journey to hold me accountable to live my two guiding principles:

1. Explore
2. Share
