      <description>Deploying Flask Apps into Google Cloud Platform There are many Flask tutorials online that describe the details of using the lightweight Python framework. With this series I do not intend to recreate the exhaustive tutorials that have been done. I simply wanted a quick 3-post series to get up and running with deploying Flask to GCP App Engine and using data from Big Query.
Within this post, Part 1, we will create a Flask app locally and then push it to GCP App Engine.</description>

      <description>My name is Jeremy Buss and throughout my life I have been inquisitive. In elementary school this passion took the shape as a love of reading. I would spend most evenings after school reading anything I could get my hands on. I especially loved reading stories about people and the impact they made. It felt like I had a backstage pass to the lives of influential individuals.
As I progressed through high school and into college this inquisitive nature led me to study physics and mathematics.</description>
