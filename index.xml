      <description>My name is Jeremy Buss. Throughout my life I have been inquisitive about the world. This passion manifested early as a love of reading. Spending most evenings after school reading anything I could get my hands on. I loved reading stories about people and how they grew up and made an impact. It felt like I had a backstage pass to the lives of influential individuals. As I progressed in high school and college this inquisitive nature led me to study physics and mathematics.</description>
